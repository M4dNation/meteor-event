## Install

`meteor add m4dnation:meteor-event`

## About

An event based declaration package for [**Meteor**](https://www.meteor.com).

If you have ever worked with some PHP frameworks such as Symphony or Laravel before using Meteor, you must have notice a lot of things are handled thanks to event based declarations.

The idea is simple: you fire an event and you have a class able to handle it and process things.  
This is very useful when you have to process similar treatments in different part of your application whenever something occurs.  
For example, you may have to send a notification email each time a user is doing some specific treatment.

This is exactly what you can do thanks to this package.

## Usage

The package is based on two classes named `Event` and `EventListener` which provide basic behavior.  
Thus, you just have to inherit from these classes in order to create an Event Based Application.

All of this is only available server-side (you cannot use this package in a Blaze Template or a React component).

```javascript
// in an eventlistener.js file (server side only)
import { EventListener } from "meteor/m4dnation:meteor-event";

export class UserActionListener extends EventListener {
  constructor() {
    super({
      name: "UserActionListener",
      listen: ["test"],
      shouldQueue: false, // If this is set to true, the process is queued
      autoRegister: true, // If this is set to false, you have to manually register the listener
    });
  }

  handle(event) {
    console.log("I am the " + this.name + ".");
    console.log("I handle the event named " + event.name + ".");

    // You can process here on your event

    // If the handle method returns true, the propagation is stopped.
    return true;
  }
}

// in an event.js file (server side only)
import { Event } from "meteor/m4dnation:meteor-event";

export class UserAddEmailEvent extends Event {
  constructor(options) {
    super(options.name);
    this.email = options.address;
  }
}

// in the server.js file (or a startup file loaded server side)
Meteor.startup(function() {
  // The instanciation is enough because autoRegister is set to true by default.
  new UserActionListener();
});
```

Then, you just have to create an instance of the declared event (for example in an `addEmail` method of your application) and fire it to see the magic occurs.

```javascript
// in a method.js file
Meteor.methods({
  "user.addEmail": ({ email }) => {
    // here we check if the user can do the process...

    // if so, we can process the method, create our event instance and fire it
    if (Meteor.isServer) {
      let event = new UserAddEmailEvent({
        name: "test",
        address: email,
      });

      event.fire();
    }
  },
});
```

### Contributing to the package

We try to keep `meteor-event` as simple as possible.

Taking into account the previous points leads us to **NOT** merge proposed pull-request if those :

    - Integrate changes that are too far from the initial purpose of the package

This being said, we **really** welcome pull-request and bug report, so feel free to start a contribution.
Moreover, Pull Requests should always come with related unit tests, and won't be considered if tests aren't included.

### Testing

`meteor-event` uses jest for unit testing.  
If you don't know about jest yet, you can check out their [documentation](https://jestjs.io/en/).
